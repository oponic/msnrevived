# MSN Revived
remember like the the msn crap from the Pasts.
<br>it still exists but like what if it was like decent and modern :o
##### that's what this is omg omg :o
written in some .NET and stuff
<br>microsoft will not be suing me for using their installer music
<br>installers don't need music
<br>>:(
<br>

# Planned Features
- dial-up emulation (not the speeds, the Experience of Dialing.)
- media player functions (wmp but um it can play mp5)
- instant messenger (escargot)
- email client (nor ourlook)
- MSN Accounts (data is not stored on servers, data can not be transfered, data is worthless. realistically it's all in like a json or something random file and you can move that file to transfer data and allow signing into the fake account)
- 2011 emulation (amazing year)
